#### We demonstrate using data from Figure 4. The raw files are available at:
 ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000084110/raw/Raw_Spectrum_Files/

#### Raw files from chip 1 were processed using MaxQuant.<br/>MaxQuant gives a combined folder. Under this is a txt folder. One of the output files is proteinGroups. This file is:

data\PNNL TMT SC\proteinGroups_PNNL_TMT_SC_Chip1.txt<br />

#### The first column is the IDs. Later reporter intensities are identified. These intensities are saved saved in idividual files below, for readability. Each of these represents a separate TMT run. In our figures we use the run from row A on Chip 1. Note that separating the data into these tables is not necessary but was done for clarity.
